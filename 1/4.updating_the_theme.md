UPDATING THE THEME
==================
UPDATE PREPARATION: BACKING UP THE CURRENT SITE
-----------------------------------------------
Updates are very easy to do, but because one is dealing with the internet, and also several different programs attempting to work together, sometimes updates will fail, and "bad things" can happen to your existing site.  If you have made a backup, then the problems should be reversible.

Wordpress has the ability to export the current web content as a Wordpress xml file, so it is suggested to use this feature, found in **Tools** -> **Export** options page. Also the theme options can be exported by way of the **Export Striking MultiFlex Options Data**  setting in the **Striking** -> **Advanced** -> **Import & Export** Settings tab.

Don't worry - updates rarely fail, and we are here to assist. If you made a backup, then there is unlikely to be any issues at all even should something go away.

The Wordpress.org plugins section has many good backup programs to choose from. Choose one that is up to date and is highly rated. Check out Wordpress official document about backing up a database at:

UPDATING USING THE BUILT IN THEME UPDATE FUNCTION
------------------------------------------------
As in performing a new install, there is more than one way to do an update the Striking MultiFlex Theme.  The theme has a built-in updating feature and update notifications are published via our own API and it pushes to all theme installs a notification of updates in the same manner as does Wordpress (this is a wp feature which theme designers can also utilize).

Once an update notification has shown up in the Wordpress dashboard, go to **Striking** -> **Advanced** -> **Update Your Striking Theme** tab where will be found the settings for triggering the installation of the update.  The settings contain detailed help fields to walk you through the correct operation of the settings.

Should the auto update function not work there is always the traditional fallback of updating by using an FTP client.  The internal update function can fail due to connection time outs, security restrictions the webhost has in place, or even security plugins within the theme which may block connections to external api's.  One should not be alarmed if the function does not work.  Such occurrences will be rare, but we suggest attempting once or twice, and after that consult with support staff at the Striking Support Forum.

**Again, an important consideration of updating is that one should always have made a backup of their site and database prior to performing an update.**

### UPDATING BY FTP ###
Download the latest version of Striking MultiFlex from Themeforest to your hard drive. As long as you are a purchaser of Striking MultiFlex, you are always entitled to all upgrades free.  So check back every so often to the Striking MultiFlex page on Themeforest.  If you see that an upgrade has been released and you have an older version number, log into your account, go to the downloads page of your Themeforest account interface, and download Striking MultiFlex again.

It’s not a bad idea to create a new folder for the new version being downloaded so that when saving and unpacking the download one does not overwrite the older version.  Unzip the download. As with a new install only *striking_r*  folder from the folders unzipped, is needed for the upgrade.  It is very easy to do an update via ftp. Open the ftp client, and on the hard drive side, navigate to the *striking_r* subfolder. On the host side, navigate to the Wordpress theme directory: **wp-content/themes** where the current version of Striking MultiFlex is installed.

Simply drag over the *striking_r* folder from the drive side to the themes folder side (drop it in a white space area), the ftp program will pop up a dialog asking if you wish to overwrite or merge your transfer with the existing *striking_r* folder to which you click “Yes” and it will proceed with the transfer.  BE CAREFUL – check the name of the folder it is indicating it is going to replace,  or if it starts to proceed without requesting overwrite permission: this latter indicates it is installing as a subfolder of the current striking folder instead, which is incorrect.

Log back into your Wordpress admin and go to **Appearance** -> **Themes** panel.  The latest version of Striking  Responsive should now show as installed (check the version number).  The update is complete.

Many often worry that upgrading by ftp overwrite will cause one to lose the existing content they have input into their site. This is not the case.  The website content, formatting and images are not affected, nor is any custom css input into the custom css box in the Striking MultiFlex General panel. This is as all content in a site is stored in the database, and a theme update is only dealing with theme files, not the database.

However, if you have made any custom modifications to your php files - for example you have hardcoded changes to a file, you will lose those modifications in the update method above. All hardcoded files should  saved prior to updating, so that the custom code can be imported into the new versions after the global program update.

### CAUTION: WORDPRESS CORE UPDATES ###
NOTE:  Be advised that **Wordpress Core updates** differ from theme updates in that Wordpress core updates **often target the database structure**.  So before installing a Wordpress update, performing a site and database update can be a very wise move – there are tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of websites over time that have crashed after a wp core update for varying reasons, and a backup in this situation will allow restoring the site without too much heartache……

As well, Wordpress has moved to an auto updating feature as of WP 3.7.  This feature is strongly biased towards users of either the default wp theme, or Wordpress.com and biased against independent premium theme developers, who cannot test out the final release until after the fact to determine its impact on the theme.  Therefore, we strongly recommend disabling auto updating of the Wordpress core even for minor updates -> in the past many minor WP updates have been plagued with issues, and the Striking Developer urges caution since any database update has the potential to irreparably damage a website.  Please go to [Configuring Automatic Background Updates][7] to learn more about the topic and how to disable.
